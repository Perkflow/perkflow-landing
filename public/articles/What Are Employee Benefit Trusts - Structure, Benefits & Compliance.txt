What Are Employee Benefit Trusts? Structure, Benefits & Compliance



Employee benefit trusts represent a powerful yet often misunderstood tool that companies use to manage employee incentives and share ownership. These specialised legal arrangements have become increasingly popular amongst both public and private companies seeking to attract, retain, and motivate their workforce through equity-based compensation.

Companies ranging from FTSE 100 giants to small private enterprises utilise these trusts to facilitate everything from executive bonuses to all-employee share ownership programmes, making them an essential component of modern employee compensation strategies.

Key Takeaways

Employee benefit trusts are independent legal entities that hold company assets for employee benefit.

These trusts offer significant flexibility for companies to implement various employee incentive schemes.

Trustees operate independently from the company to ensure the best interests of employee beneficiaries

What is an Employee Benefit Trust?

An employee benefit trust is a discretionary trust established by a company to hold assets, typically shares or cash, for the benefit of its employees, former employees, and their dependents.

The trust operates independently from the company, with professional trustees making decisions in the best interests of employee beneficiaries. This independence provides crucial protection for employees, ensuring that their interests remain safeguarded even if the company faces financial difficulties.

Asset Types Commonly Held:

Company shares

Cash reserves

Investment portfolios

Other financial instruments

The trust structure ensures that trustees maintain complete independence from company directors. This separation prevents conflicts of interest and ensures decisions prioritise employee welfare over company objectives.

Primary Business Objectives:

Talent retention through attractive benefit packages

Performance incentivisation via share-based rewards

Succession planning for business transitions

Tax efficiency in benefit delivery

Business succession represents another key application. Some companies utilize employee benefit trusts as part of employee ownership trust structures when founders retire or exit the business.



Typical Beneficiaries

Current employees form the primary beneficiary group for employee benefit trusts. These individuals must typically maintain their employment status to remain eligible for trust distributions.

Common Beneficiary Categories:

All permanent employees

Senior management teams

Long-serving staff members

High-performing individuals

Former employees may retain certain rights to trust benefits, particularly regarding vested share awards or deferred bonuses earned during their employment period.

Family members occasionally qualify as beneficiaries, though this typically applies to specific circumstances such as education grants or hardship support.

“An employee benefit trust holds assets like shares or cash for employees, former employees, and their dependents, operating independently through professional trustees to ensure impartial decision-making and safeguard employee interests, particularly in scenarios like business succession or financial difficulties.”

How Does an Employee Benefit Trust Work

The company funds the trust but cannot directly control its operations or decision-making processes.

Trustees hold the central responsibility for managing employee benefit trusts and must act independently from the sponsoring company. They make all decisions regarding trust assets and distributions based solely on beneficiaries' best interests.

Professional trust companies typically serve as trustees rather than individuals. These entities possess the expertise and regulatory compliance necessary for proper trust administration.

Key trustee responsibilities include:

Managing trust investments and assets

Making distribution decisions to beneficiaries

Ensuring compliance with legal requirements

Maintaining independence from company influence

The trustee's independence provides employees with confidence that decisions are made impartially. This separation protects trust assets even if the sponsoring company faces financial difficulties or enters liquidation.

In jurisdictions like Jersey, trustees require licensing from financial services commissions and undergo regular audits.

“Employee benefit trusts are funded by the company but managed independently by professional trustees who make impartial decisions on asset management and distributions, ensuring compliance”

Understanding the Employee Trust Deed

The trust deed serves as the foundational legal document that governs how employee benefit trusts operate. This document defines the trust's powers, limitations, and operational procedures.

The deed specifies who qualifies as beneficiaries, typically including current employees, former employees, and their dependants. Importantly, the sponsoring company is excluded from the beneficiary class to maintain independence.

Essential trust deed components:

Beneficiary definitions and eligibility criteria

Trustee powers and investment authorities

Distribution mechanisms and timing

Amendment procedures and governance rules

The document grants trustees discretionary powers to adapt the trust as company needs evolve. These flexible provisions allow employee benefit trusts to accommodate changing business circumstances and employee requirements.

Trust deeds also establish the legal framework for different benefit types, from share options to bonus arrangements. The deed's terms determine how various employee incentive programmes integrate with the trust structure.

Funding and Asset Management

Companies typically fund employee benefit trusts through direct contributions or limited recourse loans. The funding method affects both tax treatment and the trust's operational capacity.

Trustees invest these funds according to the trust deed's investment guidelines, usually in shares, loan notes, or other securities related to the sponsoring company. Investment decisions must align with beneficiaries' interests rather than company preferences.

Common funding approaches:

Cash contributions - Direct payments for immediate benefit provision

Limited recourse loans - Company lending with restricted repayment terms

Share transfers - Existing company shares moved into trust ownership

The company may make recommendations about asset allocation, but trustees retain final authority over investment decisions. This structure maintains the required independence while allowing practical coordination.

Asset management focuses on preserving and growing trust value to meet future benefit obligations. Trustees must balance investment returns with risk management to protect beneficiaries' long-term interests.



“Employee benefit trusts are funded through cash contributions, limited recourse loans, or share transfers, with trustees independently managing investments to prioritize beneficiaries' long-term interests while balancing returns and risk.”

3 Types of Employee Benefit Trusts and Related Schemes

Companies can implement various employee benefit trust structures to achieve different objectives, from share ownership to performance incentives.

1. Employee Ownership Trust

An Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) represents a specific form of employee benefit trust designed to facilitate employee ownership of companies. The government introduced EOTs in 2014 to encourage employee ownership transitions.

EOTs typically hold a controlling interest in a company on behalf of all employees. The trust structure allows business owners to sell their shares whilst maintaining the company's independent status.

Key characteristics include:

Must hold at least 51% of company shares

All employees become beneficiaries automatically

Provides tax advantages for selling shareholders

Enables tax-free bonus payments to employees

The trust operates as a discretionary trust with appointed trustees managing the shares. Employees cannot directly own or trade the shares held within the EOT structure.

2. Employee Share Ownership Plans

Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) encompass various arrangements allowing employees to acquire actual company shares. These schemes differ from EOTs as employees gain direct share ownership rather than beneficial interests.

ESOPs include both government-approved schemes and unapproved arrangements. Approved schemes receive favourable tax treatment whilst meeting specific regulatory requirements.

Common ESOP structures:

Share option schemes - employees receive rights to purchase shares at predetermined prices

Share purchase plans - direct acquisition of company shares

Performance share plans - shares awarded based on achieving targets

Companies often establish employee benefit trusts to operate these schemes effectively. The trust purchases and holds shares before transferring them to participating employees.

3. Share Incentive Plans

Share Incentive Plans (SIPs) represent government-approved employee share schemes with specific tax advantages. For example, in the UK HM Revenue and Customs regulates these plans under detailed legislative requirements.

SIPs allow companies to provide shares to employees through four distinct methods. Each method carries different tax implications and participation rules.

The four SIP share types:

Free shares - awarded without payment, up to £3,600 annually

Partnership shares - purchased from salary deductions, maximum £1,800 yearly

Matching shares - employer-provided shares linked to partnership share purchases

Dividend shares - purchased using dividends from plan shares

Companies must establish SIP trusts to hold shares on employees' behalf. Shares remain in the trust for specified holding periods to maintain tax advantages.

Employees face no income tax or National Insurance charges on free and matching shares if held for five years. Early withdrawal may trigger tax charges depending on the withdrawal timing.

“Employee benefit trusts support diverse structures like Employee Ownership Trusts for collective ownership, Employee Share Ownership Plans for direct share acquisition, and Share Incentive Plans for tax-advantaged share distribution.”

Benefits of Employee Benefit Trusts for Employers and Employees

1. Tax Advantages: It provides tax benefits for both employers and employees. Companies can deduct contributions, reducing their tax burden. Employees typically defer tax until shares are transferred or dividends are distributed. This structure allows companies to fund benefits over time, and employees can optimize their personal tax positions.



2. Enhanced Employee Engagement: Employees develop stronger connections when sharing in profits, increasing commitment and effort. Benefits include increased retention, higher productivity, improved morale, and stronger loyalty. Transparency within the trust builds trust, and companies often see improved recruitment as prospective employees value ownership opportunities.



3. Profit Sharing and Dividends: Dividends provide additional income, directly linking rewards to company performance. Mechanisms include annual distributions, performance-based allocations, service-length weighted payments, and discretionary bonuses. The flexible structure adapts to business conditions, providing employees with tangible financial benefits and improving company cash flow management.

“Employee benefit trusts deliver tax advantages by allowing deductible contributions and deferred employee taxes, while fostering engagement, retention, and productivity through aligning employee and company interests.”

How to Set Up and Manage Employee Benefit Trust

The process involves selecting qualified trustees, creating comprehensive legal frameworks, and maintaining detailed administrative records throughout the trust's operation.

1. Draft a Trust Deed

Setting up an EBT begins with drafting a comprehensive trust deed that outlines the trust's objectives and operational framework. This legal document defines the beneficiaries, specifies distribution criteria, and establishes the trustees' powers and responsibilities.

Companies must decide whether to appoint UK-resident or offshore trustees, as this choice significantly impacts capital gains tax treatment. UK-resident trustees face CGT on trust fund gains, whilst non-UK resident trustees may fall outside UK CGT scope entirely.

Key establishment requirements include:

Appointing independent trustees

Drafting detailed trust documentation

Determining funding mechanisms

Establishing compliance procedures

Professional advisors should review all documentation to ensure compliance with corporation tax provisions and anti-avoidance rules. The timing of contributions within accounting periods affects both tax relief eligibility and potential liabilities under statutory regulations.



2. Select Trustees and Professional Advisors

Trustee selection is crucial, as these individuals bear legal responsibility for acting in beneficiaries' best interests. Professional corporate trustees often provide superior governance compared to individual appointments, particularly for complex or high-value arrangements.

Trustees must operate independently from the settlor company, despite potentially receiving recommendations about trust operations.

Essential trustee qualities include:

Relevant experience with employee trusts

Understanding of tax regulations

Independence from company influence

Professional indemnity coverage

Administrative support may include specialist trustee companies that handle day-to-day operations, compliance reporting, and benefit distributions according to trust terms.

3. Ongoing Administration and Reporting

Regular reviews ensure the trust adapts to changing company needs and regulatory requirements. Trustees should assess whether current arrangements continue serving beneficiaries' best interests and adjust operations accordingly.

Administrative responsibilities encompass:

Annual tax returns and compliance reporting

Benefit distribution management

Asset valuation and investment oversight

Regulatory correspondence with HMRC

Capital gains tax relief may be available when trustees transfer assets, subject to specific conditions outlined in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Proper documentation ensures these reliefs are claimed appropriately.

Inheritance tax considerations require ongoing attention, particularly following recent legislative changes effective from October 2024. EBTs benefiting broad employee groups rather than narrow classes may qualify for favourable inheritance tax treatment under current provisions.

“Setting up and managing an employee benefit trust involves drafting a detailed trust deed, selecting independent professional trustees, and maintaining rigorous administration and compliance to adapt to evolving needs.”
