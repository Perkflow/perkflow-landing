30+ Employee Engagement Survey 
Questions to Ask (with Benchmark 
Scores & Action Plan) 
 
 
I asked our manager, "Can a company fake employee engagement?" He replied, "It's 
hard. You can offer a myriad of snacks, perks, or team-building events, but if your 
employees don’t feel heard or supported, they won’t smile at work".  That’s where 
employee engagement survey questions come into play. 
A great employee engagement survey does more than collect feedback. It helps you 
figure out what’s working, what’s not, and what needs your attention, right now. 
This guide walks you through: 
● 30+ of the best employee engagement questions to ask 
● Average benchmark scores from top industry sources 
● A simple action plan to help you respond to survey results with confidence 

Why Employee Engagement Surveys Matter 
With the rise of remote work, companies need the truth about their employees’ job 
satisfaction. You need to stay connected with workers for long-term success. 
Need to figure out what your employees are really thinking? Engagement 
questionnaires give you that mind-reading power. They take out the guesswork, 
making it more crucial than ever.   
The Data Is Clear 
I’ve seen firsthand how a simple ‘thank you’ can supercharge an employee’s entire 
week. According to Gallup, “only 33% of employees worldwide are engaged at work.” 
That means most teams are just going through the motions. They show up, but are 
not that invested. 
Also, Culture Amp reported in 2023 that engagement scores have dropped across 
multiple industries over the past year, particularly in remote and hybrid settings. 
What are the common causes? Burnout, unclear expectations, and poor 
communication. 
Here’s what you’re up against: 
● Quiet quitting 
● Lack of trust in leadership 
● Teams feeling disconnected 
● Employees are unsure if their work matters. 
When engagement improves, it shows. Companies with employees who truly feel 
supported report: 
● Up to 21% higher profitability, 17% productivity gains, and 
● 
41% less absenteeism, plus 24–50% lower turnover (depending on industry). 
Gallup also estimates that disengagement costs the global economy  $8.8–8.9 trillion 
annually, roughly 9% of global GDP. This was all due to low energy, poor retention, 
and missed opportunities for innovation. 
That’s your window for retention. When you ask powerful questions and act on 
feedback, you help your team become part of the engaged minority. 
The Real Goal of Engagement Surveys 

You’re not just running a survey to check a box. You’re trying to understand your 
people. 
A strong survey gives you three things: 
1. Clarity – What are your people experiencing day-to-day? 
2. Direction – Where should you focus your leadership efforts? 
3. Growth – How can you keep your team growing without exhaustion? 
With the right strategy, an employee involvement survey helps you build trust, boost 
your teamwork, and make informed decisions. 
“Employee engagement surveys are a crucial tool for leaders, as they provide an 
authentic understanding of job satisfaction and enable responsive action to address 
the actual needs of employees.
” 
Types of Employee Engagement Survey Questions 
to Include 
There's no one-size-fits-all survey. Since we’re humans with unique perspectives, you 
need a mix of question types to get helpful answers. Each type sheds light on a 
distinct part of the employee experience. 
But don’t worry. You won’t require a dozen frameworks. Just pick from these core 
themes that explain why they matter: 
1. Engagement Index & eNPS Questions 
These questions help you understand your team's overall sentiment. 
Example: “Would you recommend our company as a great place to work?” 
● To ask it, use a scale of 0 (Not at all likely) to 10 (Extremely likely) 
2. Purpose & Meaning 
Workers want to know their work adds value. And when they do, they turn out 
motivated. 
 
Example: “I feel my work makes a real difference.” 
● Use a simple Agree/Disagree or a 5-point scale 

3. Leadership & Trust 
If staff do not trust your leadership, engagement vanishes. 
 
Example: “I trust the decisions made by our leadership team.” 
● Use a 5-point Likert scale 
4. Manager Support & Feedback 
Most people don't leave jobs; they leave the managers. Is your manager a supportive 
and active listener? 
Example: “My manager gives me clear, actionable feedback.” 
● 5-point scale + optional comments 
5. Recognition & Belonging 
Everyone wants to feel seen and appreciated, yet this is often underrated. 
 
Example: “I receive recognition when I do good work.” or “I feel included regardless 
of my background.” 
● Use a Yes/No or 5-point scale. 
6. Growth, Learning & Development 
Personal growth fuels engagement and makes employees stay. 
Example: “I have access to the training I need to grow.” 
● To ask this, use a 5-point scale 
7. Wellbeing & Burnout Prevention 
Healthy teams perform better. So, you must check stress levels and offer support. 
Example: “I'm able to maintain a healthy work–life balance.” 
● Use a 5-point scale. 
● You can add an open-ended prompt: “What could help you feel less 
burned out?” 

And that’s your toolkit. Each theme gives you a lens on a vital part of the employee 
journey. Next, we’ll group them into a list of 30+ survey questions, including 
benchmark scores and their significance. 
“A balanced survey should cover engagement, purpose, leadership, manager support, 
recognition, growth, and wellbeing.” 
 
30+ Employee Engagement Survey Questions (with 
Benchmarks) 
Now that you know what types of questions to ask, here’s the entire list. These 
questions are drawn from real workplace surveys used by top companies and people 
ops teams. 
I’ve organized them by theme and added industry benchmark scores where 
available to help you pinpoint where you’re doing great, and where you might need 
to dig deeper. 
You're not expected to ask every question. Out of these 30, choose the best 
match for your company culture and goals.

areas across employee experience.”
 
How Many Questions Should You Use? 
To avoid survey fatigue, aim for 25–35 questions. That’s enough to be thorough. If 
you're unsure, start with 3–5 from each category and expand from there.  
Next, I'd show you how to analyze the results without getting overstrained. And how 
to turn them into an actionable plan. 
“Limit surveys to 25–35 targeted questions to avoid fatigue while capturing meaningful 
insights.” 
How to Interpret Employee Engagement Survey 
Results 

 
So, you’ve sent out your survey. The responses are in. Now what? 
Rows of data might stress you, especially if this is your first time running an 
engagement survey. Don’t worry, though. You don’t need to be a data analyst to 
understand the results. All you have to know is what to look for and how to proceed. 
Step 1: Start with the Big Picture 
Look at the overall scores in these categories. 
● The average score across all questions 
● Your eNPS score (if you included it) 
● What were the highest and lowest scores for each area (e.g., leadership, 
recognition, or burnout) 
This gives you a quick idea of what might need a closer look.  
What’s a “Good” Engagement Score? 
Here’s a general guide based on industry benchmarks (Gallup, Culture Amp): 
Score Range What It Means 

75% and above Strong, your team is thriving 
60%–74% Stable; there’s room for growth 
Below 60% At-risk; something’s off and needs 
attention 
eNPS 30+ Healthy promoter base 
eNPS 10 to 29 Mixed sentiment 
eNPS below 10 Time to investigate deeper 
Note: Benchmarks vary by industry and team size, so don’t be discouraged if you 
scored slightly below average. Rather, use your findings as a starting point for 
discussion. 
Step 2: Split it into Groups 
Instead of limiting yourself to a company-wide view, break down results by: 
● Department or team 
● Manager 
● Location 
● Tenure or role type 
 
You might find that one team feels heard and supported while another feels left out. 
And you'll be more precise when you target follow-up actions on these patterns. 
Step 3: Watch Out for Red Flags 
Low scores are more than just statistics; they are messages. Keep a close eye on: 

● Drop-offs in scores since your last survey (if applicable) 
● High scores with low comments (could mean fear of being honest) 
● Repeated low scores in trust, communication, or burnout questions 
And if you notice low participation rates? That’s a sign, too, that people may feel 
detached, unsafe, or unsure that their feedback will lead to a change. 
Step 4: Encourage the Bright Spots 
Don’t only focus on what’s damaged. But also, consider your team’s strengths. 
● Do they have a strong sense of purpose? 
● Or trust their manager. 
● Or love the learning opportunities. 
If you know what’s working, it helps you double down and influence results. 
Step 5: Scrutinize the Comments 
If you added open-ended questions, now’s the time to investigate. Look for: 
● Common themes like (“I wish we had more career growth support...”) 
● Emotional tone (Are people frustrated? Hopeful?) 
● Helpful suggestions (You might get great ideas directly from your team!) 
Advice: Don’t take critical comments personally. Treat them as data. Because when 
you’re building trust, constructive criticism is a gift. 
“Analyzing survey results by category, group, and trends helps identify priorities for 
improvement.” 
Your Employee Engagement Action Plan 
I’ve prepared a simple, step-by-step roadmap you can follow. 
 
Step Action Significance 
1 Share your results transparently, despite low 
scores 
Builds team trust and 
credibility 
2 Focus on 2–3 areas where scores dipped 
below 60–65%. Leave the rest for later. 
Makes change 
manageable and visible 

3 Set clear OKRs. Example: We must improve 
the manager feedback score from 58% to 70% 
in six months.  
Gives direction and 
accountability 
4 Co-design solutions with your team. Host 
small workshops or anonymous suggestion 
boxes 
Creates ownership and 
relevance 
5 Use quarterly pulse surveys. After your main 
survey, 5–7 pulse questions every quarter is 
ideal 
Gathers progress data 
and prevents drop-off 
6 Track ROI indicators (profitability, turnover, 
engagement). Companies with highly 
engaged teams earn 21% more profit. 
Keeps stakeholders 
informed 
7 Reflect and adjust after each survey season. 
What worked? What didn’t? Where are we still 
behind? 
Ensures continuous 
improvement 
 
“A focused, transparent action plan builds trust and drives measurable engagement 
improvements.” 
How to Interpret Results (Without Getting 
Overwhelmed) 
Most HR teams struggle here and not because the data isn’t valuable, but because 
it’s hard to prioritize what to act on first. 
With PerkFlow, you don’t have to guess. 
 Our analytics dashboard: 
● Highlight your lowest-scoring areas. 
● Benchmarks your results against industry averages. 
● Suggests specific action steps to improve each metric. 
● Automates follow-up pulse surveys to track progress. 
How to Choose the Right Employee Engagement Tool 
Before picking a platform, think about: 
1. Your team size and budget 

2. Your integration needs (Slack, Microsoft Teams, HRIS, etc.) 
3. Survey cadence required (annual vs pulse vs hybrid) 
4. Reporting needs (benchmarks, segmentation, AI insights) 
5. Anonymity and response rate tracking 
“Selecting the right tool depends on team size, budget, integration needs, and survey 
cadence.” 
Reminder: Tools Are Helpers, Not Fixes 
Using technology doesn't fix the underlying culture. As one HR expert said, platforms 
should support trust and action and not replace them. Genuine engagement comes 
from consistent follow-through, honest dialogue, and visible progress. Surveys + tools 
only work when leaders use the results to bolster lasting, innovative change. 
PerkFlow automates almost every step from OKR tracking to ROI measurement. This 
way you can focus on leading change, not managing survey logistics. 
"While technology aids engagement, it cannot substitute genuine leadership and 
cultural transformation." 
What I Recommend You Should Do Now 
1. Choose the best 25–30 questions that match your company’s culture and 
current priorities. 
2. Set meaningful goals (for example, OKRs) around improvement areas like 
leadership, feedback, or burnout. 
3. Make results visible; share them transparently, involve your team, and 
demonstrate follow-through. 
4. Use tools and templates to structure communication, planning, and pulse 
check-ins. 
5. Repeat quarterly, track progress, and scale the next cycle. 
Final Thoughts 
You’ve crafted a thoughtful employee engagement survey, gathered answers, and 
understand how to interpret the numbers. But questions alone don’t enhance 
culture or reduce turnover. Your follow-up actions do. 
 
Ask crucial questions, read results with a clear framework, and target key areas, 
OKRs, and team input to build meaningful change. 
 

Establishing a recurring, people-centered engagement routine rooted in benchmark 
insights and strategic follow-up produces more than just data. You create an 
atmosphere where employees feel empowered and safe. 
“Surveys only create value when followed by targeted actions that build trust and 
improve culture.”
